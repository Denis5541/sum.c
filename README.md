# sum.c
1. *User Input*: The program prompts the user to enter a 3-digit number.

2. *Number Validation*: The program checks if the entered number is a 3-digit number. If the number is not a 3-digit number, the program displays an error message and exits.

3. *Reverse the Number*: The program then calculates the reverse of the entered 3-digit number. To do this, it extracts the digits of the number using division and modulo operations and constructs the reverse number by multiplying and adding the digits appropriately.

4. *Check for Palindrome*: After obtaining the reverse of the number, the program compares the original 3-digit number with its reverse. If they are equal, the number is considered a magic number (palindrome).

5. *Output*: The program then displays a message indicating whether the entered 3-digit number is a magic number or not.

6. *Sample Output*:
   - If the user enters 121, the program will determine that it is a magic number since its reverse is also 121.
   - If the user enters 123, the program will indicate that it is not a magic number as its reverse is 321.

By running this program, users can quickly determine if a 3-digit number is a magic number (palindrome) or not. This can be useful for educational purposes to understand concepts like reversing numbers and checking for palindromes in programming.
